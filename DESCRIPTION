Description: Implements a comprehensive set of functions for detecting change points in mitochondrial ratio (mitoRatio) across single-cell samples. SCdetMito is specifically designed for the analysis of mitochondrial content variations in single-cell RNA sequencing data. It offers methods to identify significant change points and visualize patterns of mitoRatio alterations, making it particularly useful for exploring mitochondrial dynamics in single-cell studies. The package contributes to data quality control in single-cell RNA-seq experiments.
